This is my personal mobile app project designed to facilitate Muslim users in carrying out their daily religious habits. 

One common religious habits is to perform dzikir, which means "remembrance" in Arabic. It's a form of meditation or prayer where certain phrases are repeated to remember and praise God (Allah). 

Even if you're not familiar with Islamic practices, think of dzikir as a mindful, spiritual habit similar to repeating affirmations, mantras, or meditative chants in other traditions. Currently, the app features a dzikir counter â€” a digital tool that helps users keep track of how many times they've repeated a phrase.

More will come after I draft out what other features I should add in the app
